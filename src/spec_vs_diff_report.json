REQ-69 (ATS Resume Generator wizard + outputs) is largely present, but the diff evidence is truncated and does not conclusively show the .txt download implementation (and only partially evidences clipboard copy). Several unrelated branding/SEO/UI changes appear in the diff summary but were not requested in this BuildRequest.",
