    heading: 'Why Cold Emails Work for Internships',
    content: `Cold emailing is one of the most effective yet underutilized strategies for landing internships. While most students rely solely on job portals and campus placements, cold emails allow you to directly reach hiring managers and founders, bypassing competitive application processes.

Our internship email template for students helps you craft professional, personalized emails that get responses. Statistics show that well-written cold emails have a 15-25% response rate, significantly higher than the 1-2% success rate of mass job portal applications.

Why cold emails work:
- Direct access to decision-makers without going through HR filters
- Shows initiative and genuine interest in the company
- Allows you to stand out from hundreds of generic applications
- Builds your professional network even if immediate opportunities aren't available
- Demonstrates communication skills valued by employers

The key is personalization and value proposition. Generic "I want an internship" emails get ignored. Our professional email generator helps you create customized emails that highlight your relevant skills and show genuine interest in the company's work.`

    heading: 'How to Write Effective Internship Emails',
    content: `Writing effective cold emails follows a proven structure. Here's the framework our student email templates use:

Subject Line (Critical):
- Keep it specific and relevant: "BTech Student Interested in Frontend Development Internship"
- Avoid generic subjects like "Internship Application" or "Job Inquiry"
- Mention mutual connections if any: "Referred by [Name] - Internship Inquiry"

Email Body Structure:

1. Opening (2-3 sentences):
- Brief introduction with your name and college
- Mention how you found the company or why you're interested
- Reference specific company projects or achievements

2. Value Proposition (3-4 sentences):
- Highlight 2-3 relevant skills or projects
- Show how you can contribute to their team
- Include specific technologies or domains you've worked with

3. Call to Action (1-2 sentences):
- Request a brief call or meeting
- Offer to share your portfolio or resume
- Be specific about your availability

4. Professional Closing:
- Thank them for their time
- Include your contact information and LinkedIn profile

Our cold email for internship tool generates personalized templates following this structure. Combine this with our <a href="/resume-bullet-generator" class="text-primary hover:underline">resume bullet generator</a> to ensure your attached resume is equally impressive.`

    heading: 'Finding Companies and Contact Information',
    content: `Before sending emails, you need to identify target companies and find the right contacts. Here's how:

Identifying Target Companies:
- Research startups in your city using platforms like AngelList, LinkedIn, and Crunchbase
- Look for companies working with technologies you know or want to learn
- Check company blogs and engineering pages to understand their tech stack
- Prioritize companies with 10-100 employees (more likely to respond than large corporations)
- Consider both product companies and service companies

Finding Contact Information:
- LinkedIn: Search for "Founder", "CTO", "Engineering Manager", or "HR Manager" at target companies
- Company website: Check "About Us" or "Team" pages for email addresses
- Email patterns: Most companies use firstname@company.com or firstname.lastname@company.com
- Tools: Use email finder tools like Hunter.io or RocketReach (free tiers available)
- Twitter: Many founders and CTOs are active on Twitter and share contact info

Best Practices:
- Email founders/CTOs at startups, HR managers at larger companies
- Avoid generic emails like info@company.com or careers@company.com
- Send emails on Tuesday-Thursday mornings for better response rates
- Follow up once after 5-7 days if no response
- Track your emails and response rates to improve your approach

    heading: 'Follow-up Strategy and Email Etiquette',
    content: `Most successful internship applications involve follow-ups. Here's how to do it professionally:

Follow-up Timeline:
- Wait 5-7 business days before first follow-up
- Send maximum 2 follow-ups per company
- Space follow-ups 7-10 days apart
- Know when to move on (after 2 follow-ups with no response)

Follow-up Email Structure:
- Keep it brief (3-4 sentences)
- Reference your previous email
- Add new information (recent project, achievement, or relevant news about their company)
- Reiterate your interest and availability

Email Etiquette:
- Proofread carefully - typos hurt credibility
- Keep emails under 150 words
- Use professional email address (avoid nicknames)
- Send from Gmail or professional domain, not college email
- Include email signature with contact info and LinkedIn
- Respond promptly if they reply (within 24 hours)

What NOT to Do:
- Don't send the same email to multiple people at the same company
- Don't be pushy or entitled in tone
- Don't attach large files without asking
- Don't send emails late at night or on weekends
- Don't lie about your skills or experience

Our job application email tool helps you craft appropriate follow-ups and maintains professional tone throughout. Also check our <a href="/interview-prep-checklist" class="text-primary hover:underline">interview prep checklist</a> to be ready when you get that interview call.`

export const internshipEmailFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: 'How many companies should I email for internships?',
    answer: 'Aim to email 50-100 companies over a few weeks. With a 15-20% response rate, this should get you 10-20 responses and hopefully 2-5 interview opportunities. Quality matters more than quantity - personalize each email rather than sending mass generic emails.'
  },
  {
    question: 'When is the best time to apply for internships?',
    answer: 'For summer internships, start applying 3-4 months in advance (January-February). For winter internships, apply in September-October. However, many startups hire interns year-round, so don\'t limit yourself to traditional internship seasons.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I attach my resume to the first email?',
    answer: 'Yes, attach your resume as a PDF with a clear filename like "YourName_Resume.pdf". Keep the file size under 1MB. Mention in the email that you\'ve attached your resume for their reference. Also include a link to your LinkedIn profile and GitHub if relevant.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I don\'t have much experience to mention?',
    answer: 'Focus on academic projects, online courses completed, hackathons participated in, or personal projects. Emphasize your willingness to learn and specific technologies you\'re interested in. Even without formal experience, showing genuine interest and basic skills can get you opportunities.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it okay to email multiple people at the same company?',
    answer: 'Generally, no. Email one relevant person (founder, CTO, or HR manager) per company. If you don\'t get a response after 2 follow-ups, you could try reaching out to a different person after a month, but avoid spamming multiple people simultaneously.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I handle rejection or no response?',
    answer: 'No response after 2 follow-ups means move on - don\'t take it personally. If you get a rejection, respond professionally thanking them and asking if they can keep you in mind for future opportunities. Many internships come from companies that initially said no but remembered you later.'
