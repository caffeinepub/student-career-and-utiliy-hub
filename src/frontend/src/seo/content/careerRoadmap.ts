    heading: 'Building Skills and Projects for Your Career',
    content: `Having a roadmap is just the first step - execution is what matters. Here's how to effectively build skills and projects:

Learning Strategy:
- Follow the 70-20-10 rule: 70% hands-on practice, 20% learning from others, 10% formal education
- Focus on one technology at a time to build depth before breadth
- Use free resources like YouTube, documentation, and online courses
- Join coding communities and participate in discussions

Project Building:
- Start with simple projects and gradually increase complexity
- Build projects that solve real problems, not just tutorial clones
- Document your projects well on GitHub with README files
- Deploy your projects so they're accessible online
- Include 2-3 substantial projects in your resume

Internship Strategy:
- Start applying for internships from second year onwards
- Use our <a href="/internship-email-template" class="text-primary hover:underline">internship email template</a> for cold emailing companies
- Leverage college placement cells and online platforms
- Don't wait for the perfect opportunity - any relevant experience helps
- Treat internships as extended interviews for full-time roles

export const careerRoadmapFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: 'When should I start planning my career roadmap?',
    answer: 'Ideally, start planning your career roadmap in your first or second year of engineering. This gives you enough time to build skills, complete projects, and gain internship experience. However, it\'s never too late - even final year students can benefit from a focused 6-month roadmap.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to follow the roadmap exactly?',
    answer: 'No, the roadmap is a guide, not a rigid plan. Adapt it based on your learning pace, interests, and opportunities. The key is to maintain consistent progress towards your goal. Some topics may take longer to master, and that\'s perfectly fine.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I switch career paths after starting?',
    answer: 'Yes, many students explore multiple paths before finding their fit. The skills you learn in one domain often transfer to others. For example, programming skills learned for software development are valuable in data science too. Use the roadmap generator to create new paths as your interests evolve.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How important are certifications for career growth?',
    answer: 'Certifications can be valuable but are not mandatory. Focus on building practical skills and projects first. Certifications are most useful for cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), data science, and cybersecurity. For software development, a strong GitHub portfolio often matters more than certificates.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my CGPA is low? Can I still follow these career paths?',
    answer: 'Yes, while CGPA matters for initial screening, skills and projects can compensate for lower grades. Many companies, especially startups, prioritize skills over grades. Focus on building a strong portfolio, contributing to open source, and networking. A CGPA above 6.5-7.0 is generally sufficient if you have strong practical skills.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How many hours per week should I dedicate to skill development?',
    answer: 'Aim for 10-15 hours per week for consistent progress. This includes learning new concepts, building projects, and practicing coding. Quality matters more than quantity - focused, deliberate practice for 10 hours is better than unfocused study for 20 hours. Adjust based on your academic workload and other commitments.'
