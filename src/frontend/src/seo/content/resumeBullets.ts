    heading: 'Why Resume Bullet Points Matter',
    content: `Resume bullet points are the most critical part of your resume. They communicate your achievements, skills, and impact in a concise, scannable format. For engineering students and freshers, well-crafted bullet points can make the difference between getting an interview call and being overlooked.

Our free resume bullet generator for freshers helps you transform basic descriptions into impactful, achievement-oriented bullet points that catch recruiters' attention. The tool follows industry best practices and formats used by successful candidates at top companies.

Effective resume bullets:
- Start with strong action verbs (Developed, Implemented, Optimized, Led)
- Include specific metrics and numbers whenever possible
- Highlight the impact and results of your work
- Use technical keywords relevant to your target role
- Keep each bullet to 1-2 lines for readability

Whether you're describing projects, internships, or academic achievements, our resume writing tool helps you present your experience in the most compelling way. Combine this with our <a href="/career-roadmap-generator" class="text-primary hover:underline">career roadmap generator</a> to build the skills that make your resume stand out.`

    heading: 'How to Write Impactful Resume Bullets',
    content: `Writing great resume bullets follows a simple formula: Action Verb + What You Did + Impact/Result. Here's how to apply this for engineering students:

The STAR Method:
- Situation: Brief context of the project or task
- Task: What you were responsible for
- Action: Specific actions you took
- Result: Measurable outcomes and impact

Examples of weak vs. strong bullets:

Weak: "Worked on a web development project"
Strong: "Developed a full-stack e-commerce website using React and Node.js, handling 1000+ daily users with 99.9% uptime"

Weak: "Participated in hackathon"
Strong: "Won 2nd place among 50+ teams at XYZ Hackathon by building an AI-powered chatbot that reduced customer query response time by 60%"

Weak: "Learned Python programming"
Strong: "Implemented 5 machine learning algorithms in Python, achieving 92% accuracy in predicting student performance using scikit-learn"

Our internship resume tips tool helps you generate such bullets automatically. Just input basic information about your project or experience, and get multiple professionally formatted options to choose from.`

    heading: 'Resume Bullet Points for Different Sections',
    content: `Different resume sections require different approaches to bullet points. Here's how to handle each:

Projects Section:
- Focus on technical skills and technologies used
- Highlight problem-solving and implementation details
- Include metrics like performance improvements, user numbers, or efficiency gains
- Mention if the project is deployed or open-source

Internship/Work Experience:
- Emphasize business impact and team collaboration
- Quantify your contributions (e.g., "reduced processing time by 40%")
- Mention tools, frameworks, and methodologies used
- Highlight any recognition or positive feedback received

Academic Achievements:
- Include relevant coursework with practical applications
- Mention research projects or papers published
- Highlight leadership roles in technical clubs or events
- Include competitive programming ranks or hackathon wins

    heading: 'Common Resume Mistakes to Avoid',
    content: `Even with great experience, poor presentation can hurt your chances. Here are common mistakes engineering students make:

1. Using Passive Language: Avoid "Was responsible for" or "Helped with". Use active verbs like "Developed", "Led", "Optimized"

2. Being Too Vague: "Worked on machine learning" tells nothing. "Implemented Random Forest classifier achieving 89% accuracy on 10,000+ data points" is specific and impressive

3. Listing Responsibilities Instead of Achievements: Don't just say what you were supposed to do, show what you actually accomplished

4. Ignoring Metrics: Numbers make bullets credible. Include percentages, counts, time saved, or performance improvements

5. Using Buzzwords Without Context: Don't just list "AI, ML, Cloud" - show how you used these technologies

6. Making Bullets Too Long: Keep each bullet to 1-2 lines. Recruiters spend 6-7 seconds on initial resume scan

7. Inconsistent Formatting: Maintain uniform tense, punctuation, and structure across all bullets

Our job application help tool automatically checks for these issues and suggests improvements. It ensures your resume follows ATS (Applicant Tracking System) best practices, increasing your chances of passing initial screening.`

export const resumeBulletsFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: 'How many bullet points should I include per experience?',
    answer: 'Include 3-5 bullet points for each significant experience (internship, major project). For minor projects or older experiences, 2-3 bullets are sufficient. Quality matters more than quantity - each bullet should add value.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I include projects from online courses?',
    answer: 'Include course projects only if you significantly modified or extended them beyond the tutorial. Recruiters can spot standard course projects. Instead, build original projects or add unique features to course projects to make them resume-worthy.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I quantify achievements when I don\'t have metrics?',
    answer: 'Estimate reasonable numbers based on your project scope. For example: "Built a website handling 100+ concurrent users" or "Processed dataset of 5000+ records". You can also quantify effort: "Reduced code complexity by 30%" or "Improved load time from 3s to 1s".'
  },
  {
    question: 'What action verbs should I use for technical roles?',
    answer: 'Use: Developed, Implemented, Designed, Architected, Optimized, Engineered, Built, Created, Deployed, Integrated, Automated, Debugged, Refactored, Scaled. Avoid overused words like "Utilized" or "Leveraged".'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I include my CGPA in resume bullets?',
    answer: 'CGPA typically goes in the education section header, not in bullets. However, you can mention it in bullets for specific achievements like "Maintained 8.5+ CGPA while leading 3 technical projects" to show time management and excellence.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How often should I update my resume bullets?',
    answer: 'Update your resume after completing each significant project, internship, or achievement. Don\'t wait until job application time. Keep a master document with all experiences, then customize bullets for each application based on job requirements.'
  }
