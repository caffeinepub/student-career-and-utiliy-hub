    heading: 'Complete Interview Preparation Guide',
    content: `Interview preparation is crucial for landing your dream internship or job. Our comprehensive interview prep checklist covers everything from technical concepts to behavioral questions, helping engineering students prepare systematically.

Interviews typically consist of multiple rounds:
- Technical Round 1: Data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving
- Technical Round 2: System design, project discussion, and domain knowledge
- HR Round: Behavioral questions, cultural fit, and salary discussion
- Sometimes: Group discussion or case study rounds

Our interview preparation checklist ensures you're ready for all these rounds. The key is structured preparation over 2-3 months rather than last-minute cramming. Start with fundamentals, practice consistently, and build confidence through mock interviews.

Use this checklist alongside our <a href="/resume-bullet-generator" class="text-primary hover:underline">resume bullet generator</a> to ensure your resume accurately reflects the skills you'll discuss in interviews.`

    heading: 'Technical Interview Preparation',
    content: `Technical interviews test your problem-solving ability and coding skills. Here's how to prepare:

Data Structures & Algorithms:
- Master arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables
- Practice 200+ problems on LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeChef
- Focus on medium-difficulty problems - they appear most frequently
- Learn time and space complexity analysis
- Practice explaining your approach before coding

System Design (for experienced roles):
- Understand scalability, load balancing, caching, and databases
- Study real-world system architectures (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.)
- Practice designing systems within time constraints
- Learn about microservices, APIs, and distributed systems

Project Discussion:
- Be ready to explain every project on your resume in detail
- Know the technical decisions you made and why
- Understand the entire tech stack you used
- Be honest about your contributions in team projects
- Prepare to answer "What would you do differently?"

Our technical interview guide helps you create a study plan based on your target companies and roles. Combine this with our <a href="/career-roadmap-generator" class="text-primary hover:underline">career roadmap generator</a> to align your learning with career goals.`

    heading: 'Behavioral Interview Questions',
    content: `Behavioral interviews assess your soft skills, teamwork, and cultural fit. Common questions include:

Leadership & Teamwork:
- "Tell me about a time you led a team"
- "Describe a conflict you had with a teammate and how you resolved it"
- "Give an example of when you had to work with a difficult person"

Problem-Solving:
- "Tell me about a challenging problem you solved"
- "Describe a time you failed and what you learned"
- "How do you handle tight deadlines?"

Motivation & Goals:
- "Why do you want to work here?"
- "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
- "What motivates you?"

Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers. Prepare 5-7 stories from your academic and project experiences that demonstrate different qualities. Practice these stories until they sound natural, not rehearsed.

Our behavioral interview tips tool provides sample answers and helps you craft your own stories. Also check our <a href="/linkedin-profile-checklist" class="text-primary hover:underline">LinkedIn profile checklist</a> to ensure your online presence supports your interview narrative.`

export const interviewPrepFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: 'How long should I prepare for technical interviews?',
    answer: 'Ideally, prepare for 2-3 months with consistent daily practice. Spend 2-3 hours daily on coding problems, system design, and project review. If you have less time, focus on the most common topics and practice at least 100 coding problems.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I can\'t solve a problem during the interview?',
    answer: 'Stay calm and think aloud. Ask clarifying questions, discuss different approaches, and be open to hints. Interviewers often care more about your problem-solving process than the final solution. Showing how you think under pressure is valuable.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I mention my CGPA in interviews?',
    answer: 'Only mention CGPA if it\'s strong (8.0+) or if asked directly. Focus more on your skills, projects, and problem-solving ability. If your CGPA is lower, be ready to explain it briefly and redirect to your practical skills and achievements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How many questions should I ask the interviewer?',
    answer: 'Prepare 3-5 thoughtful questions about the role, team, technology stack, or company culture. Ask 2-3 questions depending on time available. Avoid asking about salary or benefits in early rounds - save those for HR or final rounds.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I do if I don\'t know the answer to a technical question?',
    answer: 'Be honest and say you don\'t know, but show willingness to learn. You can say "I haven\'t worked with that specific technology, but I\'ve used similar tools like..." or "I\'m not sure, but here\'s how I would approach finding the answer." Never try to bluff.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How important is the HR round?',
    answer: 'Very important - many candidates fail at this stage. HR rounds assess cultural fit, communication skills, and salary expectations. Be professional, honest, and enthusiastic. Research typical salary ranges for your role and have a reasonable expectation ready.'
